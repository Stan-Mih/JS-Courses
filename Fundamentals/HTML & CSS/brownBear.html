        <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
        <p>The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.[1][3] In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears,<br>
             while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska is known as the Kodiak bear. <br> It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative,
             <br> the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. <br> The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, the Himalayas, China, Canada, the United States, Hokkaido, Scandinavia, Finland, the Balkans, <br> the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania), Iran, Anatolia, and the Caucasus. <br> The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.</p>
